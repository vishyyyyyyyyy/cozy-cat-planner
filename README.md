üêæ Cozy Cat Planner üêæ

This is my entry for the Codedex monthly challenge!
https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/submission/[your-submission-link]

This app was built with the help of GitHub Copilot as part of the challenge to use AI assistance in development.

When I saw the challenge theme, I knew my app had to be cozy, cat-themed, and super cute! I built this desktop calendar and todo app using Electron, vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, with a dressable cat and lots of fall vibes.

Throughout development, I used Copilot to:
- Generate the Electron boilerplate and install dependencies
- Create the calendar and todo list panels
- Fix sizing issues and asset blurriness
- Translate Python logic to JavaScript for session saving
- Implement logic for screen capture of the cat
- Mass delete unused code and files
- Solve bugs (like using local time instead of UTC)
- Generate a .gitignore file
- Create animated falling leaves
- Explain code structure so I could manually fix things
- Apply quick code fixes (like border thickness, padding)

I learned that Copilot works best step-by-step, and sometimes I had to manually fix or review changes, especially for bigger refactors or when Copilot changed things I didn‚Äôt ask for. It also taught me about SVG assets and how to combine them for better quality and organization.

‚ú® Features
- Dress up your cat with different fur colors, costumes, and accessories
- Add, check off, and delete todos for any day
- Calendar view with clickable days and event/todo overview
- List view with 24-hour time slots and todos as bullet points
- Animated falling leaves background
- Kitty bubble with random messages and timed popups
- Custom app icon and desktop installer

üß† Things I learned
- How to use Electron to build cross-platform desktop apps
- How to manage app state and localStorage for persistence
- How to create interactive UI elements and overlays
- How to package and distribute an Electron app with a custom icon
- That Copilot is great for generating boilerplate, quick fixes, and explanations, but manual review is important for big changes

üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
- Add notifications/reminders for important events
- More costumes and accessories for the kitty
- Sync calendar/todos with Google Calendar
- Add more animated backgrounds for different seasons
